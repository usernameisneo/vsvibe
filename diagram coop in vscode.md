Here is a clear, conceptual diagram outline you can create to enable multiple AI coding extensions like Augment, Gemini Code, Roo Code, Cline, Kilo Code, Continue, etc., to work together, communicate, and collaborate on projects with personas, tasks, and skills:

Explanation:
Central Orchestrator is the core controller coordinating all AI extensions, managing communication and workflows.
Persona Manager defines AI personas (e.g., code reviewer, tester) assigned to specific tasks.
Task & Skills Manager tracks tasks and matches them to capabilities of each extension.
Each extension (Augment, Gemini, Roo, etc.) connects via standardized APIs or messaging protocols.
A Shared Workspace stores all ongoing work, research gathered from external sources, and intermediate outputs so extensions can build on each other’s contributions.
How to create this diagram easily
Use “Diagrams as Code” tools and AI assistants to generate architecture diagrams from text descriptions[1].
AI diagram generators (like those at eraser.io) can convert plain English prompts into visual diagrams quickly[4].
GitHub Copilot can help produce and update architecture diagrams inline in Markdown using flowchart or Mermaid syntax[5].
This architecture enables multiple AI coding assistants to collaborate seamlessly on the same project by sharing context, coordinating roles, and iterating together. Each extension contributes specialized skills, while the orchestrator ensures smooth communication and task management, forming a unified AI development teamclass=“userMessage” >create diagram
